# Project
The main idea for this project is that the user will be experiencing the infinite scrolling mechanic. I am using this to constantly generate multiple random posts every time the user reaches the end of the page. While this is happening, the manager of the site will also be posting and constantly tell you off for scrolling on his site. Eventually, he will get too angered to the point where he just gives up on trying to stop you.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to showcase that sometimes engagement with this function can be taken too far. From this, people can scroll through and come across a promising search, only to be led towards somewhere else on the web – possibly towards something predatory. It also aims to show how people shouldn’t go wasting their time constantly scrolling since the results become less and less relevant, especially those who are looking for something specific.

# Interactions
Some of the posts will feature videos which the user can play on the site.

# Aesthetics
Each time the site is loaded, the posts will be randomly generated in a different order. The same will apply for the colour scheme of the posts. The site also includes a marquee at the start along with a message from the developers. As for the posts, they generally consist of a profile picture, username, description, hashtags and possibly a video, resembling the infinite scrolling found on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

# What Will I Do Next
The next stage of my project is to think about how to space the lines to being more compact and also to try and ensure that my images are only sized for specific posts rather than across every one. Furthermore, I might also try and work out how to colour code some of my text, especially with the marquee at the top of my webpage.
